**IMPORTANT:** This is pre alpha-quality software.  Use at your own risk.

This repository is a fork of [ransford/sllurp].

It is merely a proof-of-concept to move forward with:
  * Python 3 (Python >= 3.5) in replacement of Python 2
  * The more lightweight AyncIO core module that comes with Python 3 in
    replacement of the great but heavyweight Twisted framework.

Only RFID inventory feature is supported for now and is highly experimental,
and likely incomplete.

Please refer to the original [ransford/sllurp] repository for the actual,
tested Python2 module.
